    <h2>Portobello ceramic production </h2><br>

    <p class="dig-p">
        <br>Portobello was one of the main centres of industrial ceramic production in Scotland, dating back to the 1770s or thereby. The range of wares made at Portobello, spanning two centuries, covered much of the ceramic spectrum. Activity occurred at several sites, clustered around the mouth of the Figgate Burn where it enters the Firth of Forth. A number of well- known names emerged, of which two stand out – Thomas Rathbone, celebrated for his fine painted and printed earthenware, and Alexander Buchan, famed far and wide for his utilitarian stoneware. From the 1830s this latter class of ware had been produced by a succession of firms: Cornwall Brothers, Milne & Cornwall, Milne & Smith, Thomas & Robert Tough, Thomas Tough, Murray & Buchan, starting in 1867, and finally A. W. Buchan & Co (1878-1972).<br><br>
        Their near neighbours, W. A. Gray & Sons of the Midlothian Pottery, produced almost identical utilitarian stoneware, if not quite so extensive in its range. They were famed for their patented white marmalade jars. Meanwhile, at the other site, production was continued by a number of close Buchan family members until this phase came to an end at the time of the Second World War, dictated by a variety of changing circumstances. However, having been one of the few Scottish potteries to have survived the Depression, A.W Buchan & Co was not about to slide into closure. Instead, the manufacture of utilitarian stoneware was all but given up and replaced with a product of a quite different character - decorative stoneware.Initially of a single uniform colour, a range of multi- coloured patterns developed under the guidance of Eric McKinnon Buchan. About a dozen of these were given names, but the total number ran into three figures. Favourite above all proved to be the Thistle pattern (never officially named) comprising a semi-stylised grouping featuring a thistle, heather, and bluebells, all on a sky blue background. This was hugely popular both at home and overseas, and was in great demand from countries with large populations of expatriate Scots, which contributed to Buchan’s prosperity in the post-War period. The goods were known as Thistle ware from 1946, the cleverly designed thistle trade mark was registered in 1949, and the works were known as the Thistle Pottery from 1955 until its closure. When government economic policy brought about the demise of Buchan’s at Portobello in 1972, all seventeen girls in the decorating shop were painting the famous Thistle group.This was not the end of A.W. Buchan & Co, for it relocated to Crieff, manufacture starting there even before it had ended at Portobello. It prospered, rather against the odds, still producing the Thistle and some other patterns until its sudden closure in 1999. Even then it was not totally finished, as a lone potter, Joe Hunter, and a single decorator, Karen Cramb, continue to keep the Buchan name alive. The famous Thistle mark has been re- registered, and Thistle ware, and some other lines, continue to be made.<br> Graeme Cruickshank<br><br>

    <p class="dig-p">‘A smokey, malodorous place, consisting of a group of sooty buildings situated on the sea-shore half way between Portobello and Musselburgh’ was how Joppa appeared to William Chambers in 1815 when the future publisher and Lord Provost of Edinburgh‘s family moved there when his father was appointed commercial manager of the Salt Works. The production of salt by evaporating seawater gathered in large pans using coal from the shallow local mines had been carried on in Joppa since the 1630s, part of an extensive industry along both shores of the Firth of Forth.<br<br>Originally the salt was made entirely by evaporation of sea water, but later rock salt was imported from England because the salt water product contained impurities that made it less suitable for preserving food. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries there was a tax on salt, considerably higher in England than in Scotland, and this led to a great deal of smuggling of salt into northern England, much of the produce of the Joppa Pans being used in this illicit but profitable traffic. The Chambers household were never very happy during their years at Joppa Salt Works. William goes on, ‘The business in itself violated all my father's notions of propriety. It consisted almost wholly in supplying material for a contraband trade across the Border to England,’ and later he describes their house at the Pans as ‘almost the most revolting of human habitations.’ However, he does concede that, ‘The Sundays spent on the shore of the Firth of Forth formed a refreshing change on the ordinary course of life [at work during the week in Edinburgh]. The salt-pans had ceased to send up their nauseous vapours and clouds of smoke.’<br><br>
        Late in the 19th century Joppa Salt Pans and the houses were taken over by the firm, Alex. Nisbet and Son, who also owned the salt pans at Prestonpans and Pinkie. They later formed The Scottish Salt Co. which went on producing salt at Joppa until 1953 when the last salter, Mr Towers retired. During the 20th century the company diversified into other household products in addition to salt in an attempt to meet the competition from larger manufacturers. Two such products are shown here.<br><br>

        <br>The last remnants of the Salt Pans and their small cottages were cleared away and the site is now laid out under grass, bounded on the seaward side by a low wall. But two houses once connected with the pans still remain, Rock Cottage and Rockville, between the cleared space and the Eastfield bus terminus. Rockville, now the Rockville Hotel, was built towards the end of the 19th century for the use of the Nisbet family and for a time Rock Cottage was occupied by salters employed at the pans. The house deteriorated considerably, but it was eventually renovated in the 1950s and is now a most attractive little dwelling with a fine outlook at the back over the Firth of Forth. It is about 400 years old, sturdily built with walls five feet thick, and reputed to be the oldest house on this part of the coast and certainly older than the original Portobello House. Reputedly, it was a hunting lodge belonging to the Earl of Moray long before the days of the Salt Pans.<br><br>
